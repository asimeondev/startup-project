<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a startup landing page created using Bootstrap and incorporates Mailchimp for capturing email addresses. As a web development student, I designed this landing page to gain hands-on experience in page layout using Bootstrap's responsive grid system and to learn how to set up a lead capture system with Mailchimp.

### Overview

The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and responsive landing page for a startup. By leveraging Bootstrap, I was able to utilize its pre-built CSS styles and components to design a professional-looking layout quickly. The landing page includes various sections to showcase the startup's features, benefits, and call-to-action.

In addition, I integrated Mailchimp to provide an email capture form for visitors interested in learning more about the startup. This integration allowed me to capture leads effectively and manage them through Mailchimp's user-friendly platform.
